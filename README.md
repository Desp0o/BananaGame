## 🛠 Technical Highlights

- 📱 **UIKit-based UI**  
  All interface components are created using **programmatic UI with UIKit**.

- 👆 **User Interaction**  
  Players control the character by moving it horizontally to catch items.

- 🎨 **Custom ViewControllers**  
  Game logic and UI are managed using custom `UIViewController` subclasses.

- 🧠 **Game Logic Management**  
  Smooth handling of:
  - Lives
  - Score tracking
  - Object generation
  - Collision detection
